Customized version of mrmcpowned interdimensional cable,            
you can visit it in https://topotech.github.io/interdimensionalcable/ 
                                                                     
This new version has the following features:

 · Optional support of more subs with similar content can be activated via menu.
 
     > /r/NotTimAndEric,
     
     > /r/ACIDS,
     
     > /r/fifthworldvideos,
     
     > /r/IllBeYourGuide,

     > /r/CommercialCuts.
     
   If no option is selected, /r/InterdimensionalCable will be used by default.
 
 · New system that increases randomization. 
 
 · Softened the score requirement so any video with score ≥ 1 is accepted 
   (before, the videos with score < 5 were excluded). 
 
 · Cosmetic change of the list of previously played videos: now all the elements
   should be visible in any browser and screen. 
 
 · Keyboard support! Now you can use a wireless keyboard (or joypad using joy2key
   or whatever) to watch interdimensional tv! 
 
 · The code was modified so the site can be slightly more usable in more devices.
   It was tested on Android Lollipop: it presents buggy behavior but is usable, 
   specially with virtual keyboards like Ivan Volosyuk's "WiFi Keyboard".

 · Added a slider to filter out low-score videos.
